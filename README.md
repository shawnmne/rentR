This project allows a landlord to keep track of rental properties and the renters and leases associated with them.  Image of rental property upload is handled by AWS. The app will email renters notifying them that their lease is expiring.  For demonstration purposes this is currently set to 0 days and goes every 5 minutes.  It is available for demonstration at Heroku but workers must be turned on first.  If you would like to see it in action please contact me at shawnmne@hotmail.com and I will set it up.  The Heroku address is https://quiet-gorge-91944.herokuapp.com
